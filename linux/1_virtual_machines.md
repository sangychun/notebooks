# **Virtual Machines**

The most simple definition of a `[virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)` is that it is an isolated substitute for a real computer system with a fully functioning operating system. Virtual machines have many uses, including providing an alternate software environment within an existing operating system, such as running Unix natively within a Windows computing environment. The followng tutorial will walk through the set up of a `[Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/)` virtual machine in a Windows system using the free version of `[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)`.

### Step One

Download VirtualBox:

    * Go to: [https://www.virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org)
    * Click on `Download VirtualBox 6.0` (at the time of this post, current version is 6.0)
    * Click on `Windows hosts` link to download VirtualBox

### Step Two

    * Go to your `Downloads` folder, or the folder to which you downloaded the VirtualBox and Xubuntu files
    * Double-click on the VirtualBox executable file to install on your system
    * Accept all the default options and confirm the installation procedure
