# **Linux**



# **Virtual Machines**

The most simple definition of a [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) is that it is an isolated substitute for a real computer system with a fully functioning operating system. Virtual machines have many uses, including providing an alternate software environment within an existing operating system, such as running Unix natively within a Windows computing environment. The followng tutorial will walk through the set up of a [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) virtual machine in a Windows system using the free version of [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).


# **Requirements**

Due to enterprise restrictions at the time of this post, this guide was developed based on Windows 7:

* Windows 7 (if operating system is Windows 10, then running Linus is even [easier](https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/))
* At least 4.0 GB of RAM, more would be better
* At least 20.0 GB of hard drive space
