You are now ready to install VirtualBox, and then Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on your system. In a production environment, we typically prefer LTS (Long Term Stable) versions because they are supported by the developers for a longer time than experimental versions. Ubuntu LTS versions are typically supported for up to 10 years after their release.
